              Fire.fm is a Firefox extension aimed at bringing you and
              <a href="http://last.fm">Last.fm</a> closer together. Fire.fm adds
              a new toolbar to Firefox, from which you can start Last.fm
              stations quickly and easily. Listen to music related to your
              favorite artists, and discover new artists and music in the
              process. Listen to your friends' favorite music. Find Last.fm
              users with musical taste similar to your own. Quickly access your
              favorite stations by just typing a few letters into the location
              bar.

            <p>From the
            <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/">Last.fm Help pages</a>:</p>
            <blockquote><p>
              Last.fm is a service that keeps track of what music you listen to,
              and then produces a large number of features personalized to you.
              You can use Last.fm to listen to music, find out about artists you
              may like, other people with similar music taste, gigs in your
              local area, charts and quilts for your personal site, as well as
              much more.

              Do I need to have an account in Last.fm to use Fire.fm?
            </a></h2>
            <p>
              Yes, although this wasn't always the case. Read the
              <a href="#">message at the top of this page</a> for more
              information.

            </a></h2>
            <p>
              No, you don't need the toolbar in order to use Fire.fm. You can
              hide it from your main menu, at View > Toolbars > Fire.fm. Just
              click on it and the toolbar will hide. You can access all of
              Fire.fm's features from the main menu, at Tools > Fire.fm.
            </p>
            <p>
              You can also customize the Fire.fm toolbar just like most Firefox
              toolbars! You can mix and match as you please. This way you can
              have your frequently used Fire.fm features available without
              having one whole additional toolbar.
              <a href="http://support.mozilla.com/en-US/kb/How+to+customize+the+toolbar">
                More about customizing toolbars.

            </p>
            <p>
              But wait, there's more! You can move Fire.fm's player controls to
              the Firefox Status Bar, right at the bottom right corner of your
              window. This saves a lot of space, and you can customize what
              buttons to show in it.
              <a href="#preferences">Open the Fire.fm preferences window</a>
              and look into the 'Appearance' tab. You'll find everything you
              need.

            <p>
              Well, this is <strong>radio</strong>, so we're afraid you can't
              have those. Last.fm has restrictions it has to follow in order to
              provide you with their service. We are bound to those
              restrictions as well.

            <p>From the
            <a href="http://www.last.fm/help/">Last.fm Help pages</a>:</p>
            <blockquote><p>
              Scrobbling a song means that when you listen to it, the name of
              the song is sent to Last.fm and added to your music profile.
            </p></blockquote>
            <p>
              Fire.fm has Scrobbling enabled by default. All you need to do is
              be logged in.

              How do I change my preferences /settings / options for Fire.fm?
            </a></h2>
            <p>
              The way that works for all Firefox extensions is the following:
            </p>
            <ol>
              <li>On the Firefox main menu, select Tools > Add-ons.</li>
              <li>Find the extension in the list and select it (click on it).</li>
              <li>
                You should see an Options button. It is labeled Preferences on
                Mac OS X and Linux systems. Clicking on it will open the
                preferences window. The button will be disabled if the extension
                doesn't have a preferences window (Fire.fm does).
              </li>
            </ol>
            <p>
              Fire.fm has a quicker way to access this window. On the Firefox
              main menu, select Tools > Fire.fm > Options... (the menu item is
              labeled Preferences... on Mac OS X and Linux systems). This opens
              the Preferences window.
            </p>

          <li>
            <h2><a name="shortcuts">
              Are there any shortcut keys I can use to control Fire.fm?
            </a></h2>
            <p>
              Fire.fm has limited keyboard shortcut (hot key) support, because
              most shortcuts are already taken by Firefox features. There are
              two shortcuts currently implemented that you can use:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + O opens the Start Station dialog.</li>
              <li>Ctrl + Shift + F starts / stops playback.</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            <h2><a name="gestures">
              How do mouse gestures work on Fire.fm?
            </a></h2>
            <p>
              Mouse gestures is a feature introduced in Fire.fm 1.3, works on
              Firefox 3.5 and above, and only on computers that support multiple
              finger gestures, notably recent models of the Macbook.
            </p>
            <p>
              Fire.fm supports the following gestures:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>3-finger swipe right: skip to next track.</li>
              <li>3-finger swipe up: increase volume.</li>
              <li>3-finger swipe down: decrease volume.</li>
              <li>
                3-finger swipe left-right-left: ban track. This one is a little
                tricky to prevent triggering it accidentally.
              </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              You can enable mouse gestures for Fire.fm in the
              <a href="#preferences">Preferences window</a>.
            </p>
          </li>

            </a></h2>
            <p>
              This is one of the most frequent problems experienced with
              Fire.fm, and it has been addressed in the latest version, 1.4. You
              can either wait for the automatic update to version 1.4, or go
              to our add-on page and
              <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addons/versions/7684#version-1.4">

            </a></h2>
            <p>
              Last.fm generates playlists tailored to your music taste using the
              Scrobble data you send to them while using Fire.fm or their site
              player. In order for Scrobble to work you must be logged in to
              Last.fm, and you also need to
              <a href="#password">set Firefox to Remember your Last.fm password</a>.
            </p>
            <p>
              It takes Last.fm a few days of music listening before it can
              generate a good recommended playlist for you. Use Fire.fm
              frequently and try every few days, you'll eventually get some
              recommended music! Same goes for your friends with no content :)

              What is going on?
            </a></h2>
            <p>
              Most 'Communication failed' problems are due to Last.fm's newly

            <p>
              There may be incompatibilities between Fire.fm and content-blocking
              add-ons. Fire.fm loads a local Flash player in the background to
              play tracks from Last.fm, and some content filters may block it.
            </p>

              Fire.fm loads a local Flash player in the background to play
              tracks from Last.fm, and some security applications such as
              antivirus or firewalls may block it because they consider it a
              possible security threat. Rest assured that Fire.fm is completely
              safe to use, as

              We <strong>do not</strong> advice you to disable your security
              tools, but there are usually ways to introduce exceptions to them
              so that you can use Fire.fm without problems. We'll update this
              section with information on how to enable Fire.fm on different
              security tools, but we need your help in order to do it.
